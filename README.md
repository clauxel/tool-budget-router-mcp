This is a hosted Streamable HTTP MCP server. It requires an Authorization bearer token issued after checkout and token claim.

## What It Does

ToolBudget Router MCP exposes a fixed, read-only tool surface for MCP tool routing. It is designed for agent workflows that need a hosted MCP endpoint with explicit auth, public discovery metadata, and clear data boundaries.

## Authentication

Send the paid MCP token as:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token is issued by the product checkout and MCP token claim flow. Do not put tokens in issues, pull requests, logs, or screenshots.

## Status

This public repository is a docs-only distribution package for directory review and MCP discovery. The hosted server runs at https://toolbudgetrouter.clauxel.com/mcp.
